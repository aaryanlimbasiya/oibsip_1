# Problem Statement:

The iris flower, scientifically known as Iris, is a distinctive genus of flowering plants. Within this genus, there are three primary species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. These species exhibit variations in their physical characteristics, particularly in the measurements of their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

# Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of learning from the measurements of iris flowers and accurately classifying them into their respective species. The model's primary goal is to automate the classification process based on the distinct characteristics of each iris species.

Key Project Details:

Iris flowers have three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

These species can be distinguished based on measurements such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project involves training a machine learning model on a dataset that contains iris flower measurements associated with their respective species.

The trained model will classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on their measurements.

# 1.Data Exploration: 
Through a thorough examination of the dataset, we gained insights into the characteristics and distributions of features. We found that Iris-Setosa exhibited distinct features compared to the other two species.

# 2.Data Preprocessing: 
Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables, were performed to prepare the dataset for modeling.

# 3.Model Selection: 
After experimenting with various machine learning models, tuned Random Forest was chosen as the final model due to its simplicity, interpretability, and good performance in classifying Iris species.

# 4.Model Training and Evaluation: 
The Random Forest (tuned) model was trained on the training dataset and evaluated using appropriate metrics. The model demonstrated satisfactory accuracy and precision in classifying Iris species.

# 5.Challenges and Future Work: 
The project encountered challenges related to feature engineering and model fine-tuning. Future work may involve exploring more advanced modeling techniques to improve classification accuracy further.

# 6.Practical Application: 
The Iris flower classification model can be applied in real-world scenarios, such as botany and horticulture, to automate the identification of Iris species based on physical characteristics.
